# Low-Cost-Windmill
DIY 1 m diameter wind turbine built from recycled materials and low-cost components, producing 2-5V 0.33-2.08W DC output. Includes blade design, ACâ€“DC converter circuitry, cost breakdown, and performance testing.

This project documents the design, construction, and testing of a small-scale wind turbine built during my summer holiday.

The goal: build a windmill for less money than it costs to buy a battery of equivalent output, helping me decide between studying Mechanical or Electrical Engineering.
